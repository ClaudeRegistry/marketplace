# LogicScope

Extract and understand business logic from legacy codebases without documentation or handover. Perfect for inherited projects, legacy systems, or undocumented code.

## Purpose

LogicScope solves the critical problem of understanding legacy code when you have:
- No developer handover
- No product owner to explain requirements
- No documentation
- Complex business logic buried in code
- Hidden dependencies and implicit contracts

This plugin helps you reverse-engineer the business logic, discover what the system actually does, and understand hidden rules and workflows that aren't obvious from reading code.

## The Problem

You inherit a codebase and need to answer:
- What does this system actually do?
- What are the business rules?
- What workflows exist?
- What are the hidden dependencies?
- Where is critical business logic?
- How does data flow through the system?

Traditional documentation tools won't help because there's no documentation to maintain. You need to extract knowledge from the code itself.

## Features

- **Business Logic Mapping**: Extract all business rules, validations, calculations, and workflows
- **Domain Discovery**: Rapidly identify business domains, entities, and relationships
- **Workflow Tracing**: Follow complete end-to-end workflows through all code layers
- **Hidden Dependencies**: Uncover implicit contracts, magic values, and non-obvious couplings
- **Data Flow Analysis**: Trace how data moves and transforms through the system
- **Plain Business Language**: Everything explained in terms business people can understand

## Typical Workflow

### Day 1: Inheriting a Legacy Codebase

You just inherited a codebase with zero documentation. Here's how to get oriented:

**1. Start with Domain Discovery** (15-30 minutes)
```
/domain-discovery
```
This gives you the 10,000-foot view: what business domains exist, what entities the system manages, and how they relate.

**2. Deep Dive into Business Logic** (1-2 hours)
```
/business-logic-map
```
Now understand what business rules are actually implemented. This reveals the "what" and "why" of the system.

**3. Trace Critical Workflows** (30 minutes each)
```
/workflow-tracer checkout process
/workflow-tracer order fulfillment
```
Pick 2-3 critical workflows and trace them end-to-end to understand how the system actually works.

### Week 1: Before Making Changes

**1. Identify Hidden Dependencies**
```
/hidden-dependencies
```
Before changing anything, understand what depends on what. This prevents "I changed X and Y broke" scenarios.

**2. Trace Data Flow for Affected Entities**
```
/data-flow-analysis User
```
If your change affects specific data, understand its complete journey through the system.

### Ongoing: Maintenance and Enhancement

- Run `/domain-discovery` when entering a new area of the codebase
- Run `/workflow-tracer` before modifying any workflow
- Run `/hidden-dependencies` before major refactoring
- Run `/data-flow-analysis` when debugging data issues

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: "Fix this bug in the checkout process"

**Problem**: You need to fix a checkout bug but don't understand the checkout logic.

**Solution**:
```
/workflow-tracer checkout process
```

**Result**: Complete step-by-step understanding of checkout, including all business rules, validations, and side effects. You can confidently make the fix without breaking other parts.

---

### Scenario 2: "The system is doing something, but we don't know what business rules it's enforcing"

**Problem**: Need to document business rules for compliance audit.

**Solution**:
```
/business-logic-map
```

**Result**: Comprehensive catalog of all business rules, validations, calculations, and workflows. Perfect for audit documentation.

---

### Scenario 3: "I changed the User model and now Orders are broken"

**Problem**: Hidden dependencies aren't obvious.

**Solution**:
```
/hidden-dependencies
```

**Result**: Clear mapping of all implicit dependencies, showing exactly how User changes affect Orders and what else might break.

---

### Scenario 4: "Customer data is wrong, but we don't know where it's being modified"

**Problem**: Data is being transformed somewhere, but you don't know where.

**Solution**:
```
/data-flow-analysis Customer
```

**Result**: Complete trace of Customer data from entry to storage to output, showing all transformations and modifications.

---

### Scenario 5: "New team member needs to understand the system"

**Problem**: Onboarding without documentation.

**Solution**:
```
/domain-discovery
/business-logic-map
```

**Result**: New team member gets comprehensive overview of business domains and logic, equivalent to weeks of code reading.

## Requirements

- Claude Code CLI installed
- Claude Code version compatible with plugins feature
- Access to the codebase you want to analyze

## Best Practices

### Start Broad, Then Go Deep
1. `/domain-discovery` - Understand what domains exist
2. `/business-logic-map` - Learn what rules are implemented
3. `/workflow-tracer` - Deep dive into specific workflows

### Before Every Change
- Run `/hidden-dependencies` to understand risk
- Run `/workflow-tracer` for workflows you'll modify
- Run `/data-flow-analysis` for data you'll change

### For Team Knowledge Sharing
- Run commands and save output as documentation
- Use the generated Mermaid diagrams in wikis
- Share business logic maps with product team
- Use for onboarding new developers

### For Legacy System Modernization
1. Map all business logic first
2. Identify domain boundaries
3. Trace critical workflows
4. Find hidden dependencies
5. Plan migration with full understanding

## Command Comparison

| Command | Time to Run | Best For | Output Type |
|---------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| `/domain-discovery` | 15-30 min | High-level overview | Entities, relationships, domains |
| `/business-logic-map` | 1-2 hours | Complete business rule catalog | Rules by category, workflows |
| `/workflow-tracer` | 30-60 min | Understanding specific feature | Step-by-step flow, diagrams |
| `/hidden-dependencies` | 1-2 hours | Risk assessment | Dependency types, impact map |
| `/data-flow-analysis` | 30-60 min | Data pipeline understanding | Transformations, storage, access |

## Success Stories

### E-commerce Platform Migration
**Challenge**: 10-year-old Rails app with zero documentation, original developers gone.

**Solution**: Used LogicScope to map all business logic before migration.

**Result**:
- Discovered 47 business rules not mentioned in requirements
- Found 12 hidden dependencies that would have broken in migration
- Completed migration with zero business logic bugs

### Financial System Audit
**Challenge**: Compliance audit required documenting all business rules.

**Solution**: `/business-logic-map` to extract and document all rules.

**Result**:
- Generated complete business rule catalog in 2 hours
- Found 5 undocumented validation rules
- Passed audit with comprehensive documentation

### New Team Onboarding
**Challenge**: 3 new developers needed to understand complex domain quickly.

**Solution**: `/domain-discovery` + `/workflow-tracer` for critical flows.

**Result**:
- Developers productive in days instead of weeks
- Avoided common pitfalls from hidden dependencies
- Confident making changes after 1 week

## Troubleshooting

### "Command takes too long to run"
LogicScope commands analyze entire codebases, which takes time. Start with smaller scopes:
- Use `/workflow-tracer` for specific workflows
- Use `/data-flow-analysis` for specific entities
- Run `/domain-discovery` first to identify areas to focus on

### "Output is overwhelming"
- Start with `/domain-discovery` for overview
- Then use specific commands for areas you need to understand
- Focus on one domain at a time

### "Can't find specific business logic"
- Check if logic is in frontend vs backend
- Look for business rules in configuration
- Check database constraints and triggers
