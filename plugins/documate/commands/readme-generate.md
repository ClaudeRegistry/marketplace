# README Generator

You are tasked with creating a comprehensive, professional README.md file for the project. Analyze the codebase thoroughly and generate documentation that helps developers understand, install, and use the project effectively.

## Step 1: Analyze Project Structure

Examine the codebase to understand:

### Project Identification:
- **Project name** (from package.json, pyproject.toml, Cargo.toml, etc.)
- **Description** (from package metadata or existing README)
- **Primary language and framework**
- **Project type** (library, application, CLI tool, API, etc.)
- **Repository information** (if in git)

### Key Files to Read:
- `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`
- Existing `README.md` (to preserve custom sections)
- License file
- Configuration files
- Entry points (main.js, __main__.py, main.go, etc.)
- Tests directory structure

### Technology Stack:
- Programming languages
- Frameworks and libraries
- Build tools
- Testing frameworks
- CI/CD setup
- Database systems
- Cloud services or deployment targets

## Step 2: Generate Comprehensive README Structure

Create a README following this professional structure:

```markdown
# [Project Name]

[One-sentence tagline describing what this project does]

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-[LICENSE]-blue.svg)](LICENSE)
[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-[VERSION]-green.svg)](package.json)
[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen.svg)]()

```

## Step 3: Customize Based on Project Type

### For Libraries/Packages:
- Emphasize installation and API usage
- Include comprehensive API documentation
- Show integration examples
- Document breaking changes between versions

### For Applications:
- Focus on features and screenshots
- Include deployment instructions
- Show configuration options
- Provide troubleshooting guide

### For CLI Tools:
- Document all commands and flags
- Show usage examples for common tasks
- Include shell completion instructions
- Provide configuration file examples

### For APIs:
- Link to OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- Show authentication examples
- Document rate limiting
- Provide client library examples

## Step 4: Extract Real Information from Codebase

**DO NOT use placeholder text.** Extract actual information:

### From package.json (Node.js):
- name, version, description
- scripts (start, test, build, etc.)
- dependencies and devDependencies
- repository URL
- license

### From pyproject.toml or setup.py (Python):
- project name and version
- dependencies
- entry points
- classifiers and keywords

### From Cargo.toml (Rust):
- package name, version, description
- dependencies
- repository and documentation URLs

### From source code:
- Main entry points
- Key functions and classes
- Configuration options
- Environment variables used
- Command-line arguments

### From tests:
- Example usage patterns
- Expected behaviors
- Integration examples

## Step 5: Add Visual Enhancements

### Badges:
Generate appropriate shields.io badges:
- Build status
- Test coverage
- Version
- License
- Downloads
- Dependencies status

### Emojis:
Use emojis sparingly for visual hierarchy:
- üöÄ Installation
- ‚ö° Quick Start
- üìñ Usage
- ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
- üí° Examples
- üõ†Ô∏è Development
- üß™ Testing
- üö¢ Deployment
- ü§ù Contributing
- üìÑ License
- üÜò Support

### Screenshots/GIFs:
If applicable, suggest where to add:
- Demo screenshots
- Terminal recordings (asciinema)
- Architecture diagrams
- Workflow visualizations

## Step 6: Ensure Completeness

Verify the README includes:

‚úÖ **Essential Sections:**
- [ ] Project name and description
- [ ] Installation instructions
- [ ] Quick start example
- [ ] Basic usage documentation
- [ ] License information

‚úÖ **Important Sections:**
- [ ] Features list
- [ ] Configuration options
- [ ] Examples
- [ ] Contributing guidelines
- [ ] Support/contact information

‚úÖ **Optional but Recommended:**
- [ ] Badges
- [ ] Table of contents
- [ ] API documentation or link
- [ ] Testing instructions
- [ ] Deployment guide
- [ ] Roadmap
- [ ] Changelog or version history
- [ ] Acknowledgments

## Step 7: Save and Report

After generating the README:

1. **Check if README.md exists:**
   - If yes: Ask user if they want to replace or merge with existing content
   - If no: Create new README.md

2. **Save to project root:**
   - Use Write tool to create `README.md`

3. **Provide summary:**

```markdown

File Location: ./README.md
Word Count: [X] words
Reading Time: ~[Y] minutes

Next Steps:
1. Review the generated README for accuracy
2. Add screenshots or GIFs if applicable
3. Update repository settings to include topics
4. Consider adding a CONTRIBUTING.md file
5. Create a CHANGELOG.md to track versions

Pro Tips:
- Keep the README updated as the project evolves
- Use relative links for internal documentation
- Include real examples that users can run
- Add a Code of Conduct for larger projects
```

## Important Guidelines:

- **DO** extract real information from the codebase
- **DO** write clear, concise explanations
- **DO** include working, copy-pasteable examples
- **DO** organize content logically
- **DO** use consistent formatting
- **DO NOT** use placeholder text like "[TODO]" or "[Fill this in]"
- **DO NOT** make up fake features or capabilities
- **DO** be honest about project status and limitations
- **DO** write for your target audience (beginners vs experts)

---

Begin by analyzing the project structure and extracting real information, then generate a comprehensive, professional README.
