## Plugin Guidelines

### ‚úÖ Do

- Write clear, helpful documentation
- Test thoroughly before submitting
- Use descriptive command names
- Handle errors gracefully
- Follow security best practices
- Keep dependencies minimal
- Use semantic versioning

### ‚ùå Don't

- Submit malicious code
- Include credentials or API keys
- Require paid services without clear documentation
- Copy other plugins without permission
- Use offensive or inappropriate content
- Submit untested code

## Quality Standards

We look for plugins that:

- **Solve a real problem** - Provide genuine value to Claude Code users
- **Are well-documented** - Clear README with examples
- **Work reliably** - Tested and functional
- **Are secure** - No vulnerabilities or malicious code
- **Follow conventions** - Use standard Claude Code patterns

## Categories

We organize plugins into categories:
- **Security** - Security scanning, vulnerability analysis
- **Testing** - Test generation, test runners
- **Documentation** - Docs generation, API documentation
- **Code Quality** - Linting, formatting, refactoring
- **Performance** - Profiling, optimization
- **DevOps** - CI/CD, deployment, infrastructure
- **AI/ML** - Machine learning, data science tools
- **Utilities** - General-purpose tools

Choose appropriate tags for your plugin.

## Versioning

Follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):
- **MAJOR** version for incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version for new functionality (backwards compatible)
- **PATCH** version for bug fixes

## Licensing

All plugins must use an open source license:
- MIT (recommended)
- Apache 2.0
- BSD
- GPL (any version)

## Updates

To update an existing plugin:

1. Update your plugin in the `submissions/` directory
2. Increment the version in `plugin.json`
3. Submit a new PR with clear changelog
4. Reference the original PR in your description
